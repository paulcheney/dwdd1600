        <h1>Woodworking History</h1>
        
        <h2>Ancient Egypt</h2>
        <p>There is <em>significant evidence</em> of advanced woodworking in ancient Egypt. Woodworking is depicted in many ancient Egyptian drawings and a considerable amount of ancient Egyptian furniture (such as stools, chairs, tables, beds, chests). Tombs represent a large collection of these artefacts and the <strong>inner coffins</strong> found in the tombs were also made of wood.</p>
        <p>Commonly used woodworking tools included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>axes</li>
            <li>chisels</li>
            <li>saws</li>
            <li>bow drills</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Ancient Rome</h2>
        <p>Woodworking was essential to the Romans and provided material for buildings, transportation, tools, and household items. Wood also provided pipes, dye, waterproofing materials, and energy for heat. </p>
        
        <h2>Materials for Woodworking</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Hardwood</dt>
            <dd>Hardwood is wood from dicot trees which are found in broad-leaved temperate and tropical forests</dd>
            <dt>Softwood</dt>
            <dd>Softwood is wood from gymnosperm trees such as pines and spruces</dd>
            <dt>Plywood</dt>
            <dd>Plywood is a material manufactured from thin layers or "plies" of wood veneer that are glued together with adjacent layers having their wood grain rotated up to 90 degrees to one another</dd>

        <h2>Modern Times</h2>
        <p>With the advances in modern technology and the demands of industry, woodwork as a field has changed. The development of <a href="https://tormach.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Computer Numeric Controlled Machines</a>, for example, has made us able to mass-produce and reproduce products faster, with less waste, and often more complex in design than ever before. Hand tools while still used by some can really slow down complicated and highly detailed shapes into flat stock, to create signs or art. Rechargeable power tools speed up creation of many projects and require much less body strength than in the past, for example when boring multiple holes. Skilled fine woodworking, however, remains a craft pursued by many. There remains demand for hand crafted work such as furniture and arts, however with rate and cost of production, the cost for consumers is much higher. --<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodworking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SOURCE</a></p>
