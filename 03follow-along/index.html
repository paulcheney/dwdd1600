        <h1>Declaration of Independence</h1>
        <p>The unanimous <strong>Declaration of the thirteen united States</strong> of America, When in the Course of human events, it
            becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and
            to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of
            Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the
            causes which impel them to the separation.</p>
        <h2>Problems with the King</h2>
        <p>The history of the present <em>King of Great Britain</em> is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</li>
                <li>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</li>
                <li>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</li>
                <li>He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.</li>
            </ul>
