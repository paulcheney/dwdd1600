        <h1>Declaration of Independence</h1>
        <h2>What it Says</h2>
    
        <p>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that <strong>all men are created equal</strong>, that they are endowed by their
            Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of
            Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers
            from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends,
            it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its
            foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to
            effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should
            not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are
            more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to
            which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same
            Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to
            throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient
            sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former
            Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries
            and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To
            prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>
       
        <p>We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing
            to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of
            the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of
            Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British
            Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be
            totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude
            Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States
            may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine
            Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.</p>

        <h2>Why we are upset</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.</li>
            <li>He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.</li>
<li>He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.</li>
